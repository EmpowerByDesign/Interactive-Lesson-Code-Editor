## Overview

**Interactive Lesson Code Editor** is the foundation for a next-generation adaptive coding education platform. Inspired by the best of Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and hands-on learning, this project is designed to empower complete beginners and self-taught developers to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web development through interactive, personalized lessons.

This platform bridges the gap between users and AI coding tools by focusing on true coding mastery—not just code completion—with a three-panel live coding environment, gamification, immediate feedback, and learning path personalization.
