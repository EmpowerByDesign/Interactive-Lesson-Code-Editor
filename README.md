## Overview

**Interactive Lesson Code Editor** is designed to be a next-generation adaptive coding education platform. Drawing inspiration from Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and hands-on learning environments, this project aims to create a truly interactive and adaptive space for mastering web development skills. The platform bridges the gap between learners and AI-powered tools, focusing on deep understanding, skill-building, and mastery through a three-panel live coding environment, personalized pathways, gamification, and immediate feedback.
